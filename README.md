# cgpn (Cube Game Placeholder Name)

**A sandbox game built with cubes!**

## Wait... This looks nothing like a game >:(

We know, we know.
We're building this program from the ground up to offer the maximum runtime efficiency possible to the players.
It will be a long journey, but we will really enjoy it when we get there!

## Placeholder name?

Unfortunately, yes.
Contact us if you have a great name idea for the project!
